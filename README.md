# ShadowDance

ShadowDance is a game designed with an object-oriented approach, planned using UML diagrams and developed in Java. 
Players are tasked with hitting corresponding musical notes appearing in different lanes with precision timing to score points. 
The game comprises three levels of increasing complexity: 
- Level 1 challenges players to achieve a target score by accurately hitting descending notes;
- Level 2 introduces special notes with unique effects alongside the core gameplay;
- Level 3 escalates the challenge further by introducing enemies that attempt to steal notes and a guardian to protect them.

Players must beat target scores to progress through each level and emerge victorious in this rhythmic adventure.
